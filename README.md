Hi there, I'm Mary Ann 👋

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at UNC Charlotte and aspiring Andriod developer. I'm interested in creating mobile apps that balance functionality with a clean, intuitive design.
💡Currently, I'm learning about **Operating Systems, AI, and Software Engineering** through my CS coursework, as well as studying Andriod development with Java/Kotlin.

🧰Tech & Tools
**Languages**: Java, Python (future: Kotlin, Dart)
**Frameworks/Platforms**: Andriod Studio, Git/GitHub (future: Flutter)

🙋‍♀️ About Me
Faith and community are core parts of my life - I stay grounded through church, journaling, and fellowship. Outside of coding, you'll find me taking nature walks or listening to music. I'm exicted to blend **tech & creativity** to design apps that make life easier.
